        Marvel’s “Captain America: Civil War” finds Steve Rogers leading the newly formed
        team of Avengers in their continued efforts to safeguard humanity.
        But after another incident involving the Avengers results in collateral damage,
        political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability,
        headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. 
        
        The new status quo fractures the Avengers, resulting in two camps—one led by 
        Steve Rogers and his desire for the Avengers to remain free to defend 
        humanity without government interference, 
        and the other following Tony Stark’s surprising decision to support government
        oversight and accountability.
